# Toggle Notch Off/On (shortcut)

This shortcut moves the entire menubar beneath the camera housing (the “notch”) on Apple Silicon MacBooks, using AppleScript to automate the procedure described [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/432284/make-macbook-pro-as-if-there-is-no-notch/472341#472341).

_Advantages_

- app menu bar items in a continuous row
- more space for menu bar apps, for example, system stat apps
- enjoy screensavers without the constant presence of an annoying black object at the top of the screen
- restores the original pre-Apple Silicon MacBook design

Run the shortcut again to have the notch back in the middle of the menu bar
